AudioPlaybackConnector2 is a small Windows tray app for connecting paired Bluetooth audio devices as Windows playback outputs. It uses the Windows `AudioPlaybackConnection` API so you can connect, disconnect, and reconnect A2DP devices without opening Windows Settings.

Built with **WinUI 3 Desktop**, **C++/WinRT**, and distributed as **MSIX**.

## Quick Start

1. Pair your Bluetooth speaker, headset, or other A2DP audio device in Windows.
2. Download the latest `.appinstaller` and `.cer` from [Releases](https://github.com/N0ahTM/AudioPlaybackConnector2/releases/latest).
3. Trust the `.cer` certificate once.
4. Open the `.appinstaller` file to install the app with its update feed.
5. Launch AudioPlaybackConnector2 and use the tray icon to manage devices.

For commands and certificate-store options, see [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

## Features

- Tray-only workflow with no main window.
- Fast device picker on left-click.
- Connect, reconnect, and disconnect devices from the picker.
- Double-click the tray icon to toggle the most recently connected device.
- Disconnect or reconnect all active devices from the tray menu.
- Global and per-device auto-reconnect on startup.
- Guarded device actions so repeated clicks do not start overlapping connect/disconnect work.
- Animated, theme-aware tray icons for idle, connecting, connected, and error states.
- Toast notifications for connection events, failures, and available updates.
- Optional start with Windows.
- Manual update checks through GitHub Releases and the App Installer feed.
- Settings window placement persistence.
- Local crash reports and minidumps for troubleshooting.
- Localized UI in eight languages.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 version 2004 or newer.
- A Bluetooth adapter with A2DP support.
- A paired Bluetooth audio playback device.
- MSIX installation through a release package or local build.

## Usage

- **Open device picker:** Left-click the tray icon.
- **Open tray menu:** Right-click the tray icon.
- **Quick toggle:** Double-click the tray icon to connect or disconnect the last connected device.
- **Settings:** Open from the tray menu to configure language, startup behavior, reconnect behavior, notifications, and update checks.

## Installation Notes

The recommended install path is the `.appinstaller` file from the latest release. It preserves update-feed behavior and pulls in required framework packages such as VCLibs and the Windows App SDK runtime.

Direct `.msix` installation is still possible, but missing framework dependencies may need to be installed manually and update-feed behavior is not preserved.

Releases are currently signed with a self-signed certificate, so Windows must trust the release `.cer` before installation.
