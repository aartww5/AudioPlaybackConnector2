AudioPlaybackConnector2 is a Windows system-tray application for connecting Bluetooth audio devices as A2DP audio sinks using the Win32 `AudioPlaybackConnection` API.

The app is built with **WinUI 3 Desktop**, **C++/WinRT**, and packaged as an **MSIX**.

Inspired by the original [AudioPlaybackConnector](https://github.com/ysc3839/AudioPlaybackConnector).

The device picker shows available Bluetooth A2DP audio devices. Select a device to connect it as an audio playback sink.

Connected devices show a disconnect button directly in the picker.

Right-click the tray icon.

Available actions:

## Tray Behavior

The tray icon reflects the current connection state:

| Error | Error-state icon and tooltip message |

The icon is rendered programmatically and adapts to light and dark Windows taskbar themes.
