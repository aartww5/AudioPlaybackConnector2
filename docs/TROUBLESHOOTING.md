# Troubleshooting

## `DEP0840` / missing WinAppRuntime packages

If you installed via `.appinstaller`, the required framework dependencies (including the Windows App SDK runtime)
should be installed automatically. If you still see `DEP0840` mentioning missing packages such as
`MicrosoftCorporationII.WinAppRuntime.Main.2` or `MicrosoftCorporationII.WinAppRuntime.Singleton`, install them manually:

1. [WinAppRuntime.Singleton](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p5z076k079h)
2. [Windows App SDK 2.0 runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/downloads#windows-app-sdk-20)

Then retry install/launch.

> This usually only happens when installing the raw `.msix` directly without the `.appinstaller` flow, or when the
> framework packages were removed from the system after the app was installed.

## App Installer protocol is disabled

Windows can report that the `ms-appinstaller:` protocol is disabled if a web install link is used:

```powershell
Start-Process "ms-appinstaller:?source=https://n0ahtm.github.io/AudioPlaybackConnector2/AudioPlaybackConnector2.appinstaller"
```

This is not specific to AudioPlaybackConnector2 and is not controlled by the MSIX package manifest. Microsoft disabled
the protocol by default on consumer devices in December 2023 after it was abused to distribute malicious MSIX packages.
Enterprise administrators can re-enable it with the `EnableMSAppInstallerProtocol` policy, but public GitHub releases
should avoid depending on that protocol.

Download the `.appinstaller` file and open the local file instead:

```powershell
$installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP "AudioPlaybackConnector2.appinstaller"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://n0ahtm.github.io/AudioPlaybackConnector2/AudioPlaybackConnector2.appinstaller" -OutFile $installer
Start-Process $installer
```

## Certificate trust errors during MSIX install

If Windows reports an untrusted publisher:

1. Install the `.cer` from the release.
2. Use either machine-wide trust (`Cert:\LocalMachine\Root`) or per-user trust (`Cert:\CurrentUser\TrustedPeople`).
3. Retry installing the `.msix` or `.appinstaller`.

See [Installation](INSTALLATION.md) for commands.

## Packaging fails because certificate thumbprint is invalid

In Visual Studio:

1. Open `Package.appxmanifest`.
2. Go to **Packaging**.
3. Create/select a local test certificate.
4. Update `PackageCertificateThumbprint` in `AudioPlaybackConnector2 (Package)`.

## C++23 compile issues in Visual Studio

If the compiler does not accept required C++ features, set language standard to `/std:c++latest` and rebuild.
