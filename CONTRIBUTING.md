# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AudioPlaybackConnector2.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 (17.14 or later) with the following workloads:
  - **Desktop development with C++**
  - **Windows application development** (for WinUI 3 / Windows App SDK)
- Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0 or later
- Windows 11 (or Windows 10 1803+ for testing)

## Building

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `AudioPlaybackConnector2.slnx` in Visual Studio 2022
3. NuGet packages restore automatically on first build
4. Build → Build Solution (x64, Debug)

See [README.md](README.md) for full build instructions and architecture details.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md). Include:
- Windows version and build number
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Relevant logs (Event Viewer → Application, or debug output)

### Suggesting Features

Use the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Verify the build succeeds: `msbuild AudioPlaybackConnector2.slnx /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64`
4. Open a pull request against `main`

## Code Style

- **C++ standard:** C++23 (`/std:c++latest`)
- **Warnings:** `/W4 /WX` — all warnings are errors; do not introduce new warnings
- **Includes:** All Windows, WinRT, WIL, and GDI+ headers belong in `pch.h`, not in individual `.cpp` files
- **Strings:** All user-visible strings must go through `_(key)` and be added to all 8 locale files in `res/strings/`
- **Thread safety:** Anything that reads or writes `DeviceManager` state must hold the appropriate `wil::srwlock`
- **Comments:** Only where the *why* is non-obvious — well-named identifiers do the rest
